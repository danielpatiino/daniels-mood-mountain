## 🛠️ Technical Notes
Mood Mountain is a client-side web app built with:
- **React** (functional components, hooks)
- **Vite** (fast dev/build tooling)
- **Recharts** (mood chart visualization)
- **date-fns** (date formatting)
- **CSS Modules** (component-scoped styles)
- **LocalStorage** (all data stays in your browser)
- **React Hooks** for state and effect management

No backend or account required. All your mood data and notes are private and stored locally. Third-party React libraries are used for charting and date handling.
